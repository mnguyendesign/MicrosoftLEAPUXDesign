## About Me

I'm an end-to-end product designer based in NYC with a passion for design ops and system design. I believe that solving problems is a creative, cross-functional, and collaborative process.

I had always wanted to help people. Growing up the only way I knew how was to get into medicine.  I was a career nomad traveling between my two passions: science and art before discovering a career that allowed me to combine the two through ux design.
